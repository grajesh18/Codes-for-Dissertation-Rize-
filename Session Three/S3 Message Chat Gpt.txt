"Remember, it's okay to feel resistant. Instead of avoiding those feelings, try to make space for them. When you notice discomfort, take a moment to observe it without judgment. Ask yourself: what values are guiding you in this moment? This can help you choose how to respond rather than react. You have the strength to explore these feelings at your own pace."
