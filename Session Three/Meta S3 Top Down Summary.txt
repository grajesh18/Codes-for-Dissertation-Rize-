ACT-Informed Summary:

The therapy session reflects several ACT principles:

1. **Cognitive Defusion**: The client is struggling with the idea of placing a number on their means of coping, which they perceive as ineffective. This is an example of cognitive fusion, where they are taking their thoughts and judgments as literal truth. The therapist helps the client to see that their thoughts are just thoughts and not necessarily reflective of reality.

Example: Client: "The idea of placing a number on the means I was using before, and them being completely ineffective." Therapist: "Well, you're several steps out ahead of me. We all have investments in whatever our thoughts are."

2. **Acceptance**: The client is struggling with the idea of accepting their current situation and moving forward, rather than trying to change it. The therapist encourages the client to accept their current state and focus on what they can control, rather than trying to control the outcome.

Example: Therapist: "The whole thing that we're working on here is trying to, at least in part, put those investments in on the basis of what works rather than on what's reasonable."

3. **Contact with the Present Moment**: The client is struggling with the idea of focusing on the present moment, rather than getting caught up in thoughts about the past or future. The therapist encourages the client to focus on the present moment and what they can control.

Example: Therapist: "Take the measures we were looking at. They are all your bottom line: how much suffering you've done and how much effort has gone on and whether or not whatever is happening there is moving you ahead toward what you really want or backward."

4. **Values**: The client is struggling with the idea of what is important to them and what they want to achieve. The therapist encourages the client to focus on their values and what they want to achieve, rather than getting caught up in thoughts about what they can't do.

Example: Therapist: "Those are pretty basic things … that don't have to have numbers. But I do like numbers. C: I don't like numbers [fusion, avoidance]."

5. **Committed Action**: The client is struggling with the idea of taking action towards their goals, rather than getting caught up in thoughts and worries about the outcome. The therapist encourages the client to take action towards their goals, even if it's just a small step.

Example: Therapist: "I asked you to do it once, at the end of the day, actually. All of this is also functionally avoidant."

6. **Observing Self**: The therapist is encouraging the client to observe their thoughts and feelings, rather than getting caught up in them. The therapist is modeling this behavior by observing their own thoughts and feelings, and encouraging the client to do the same.

Example: Therapist: "My purpose was more to see how it is than to have it be a particular way. We all have investments in whatever our thoughts are."

Overall, the therapy session reflects a number of ACT principles, including cognitive defusion, acceptance, contact with the present moment, values, committed action, and observing self. The therapist is using a number of techniques to help the client develop psychological flexibility and move towards their goals.
