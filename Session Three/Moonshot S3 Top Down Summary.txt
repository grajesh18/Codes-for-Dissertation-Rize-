ACT-Informed Summary:

ACT-consistent summary of the session

1. Experiential avoidance  
   • Client repeatedly avoids the homework task (“it wasn’t convenient… leave that exercise… can’t just leap”).  
   • Therapist labels this as “functionally avoidant,” highlighting the core ACT view that avoidance of private events (thoughts, feelings, urges) is the primary source of suffering.

2. Cognitive fusion  
   • Client fuses with thoughts such as “numbers are apples and oranges,” “I can’t trust my assessment,” and “your goal is to make the old ways look ineffective.”  
   • Therapist gently defuses by noting “we all have investments in whatever our thoughts are” and reframing numbers as one possible tool rather than absolute truth.

3. Values & workability  
   • Therapist redirects from the form of the task (numbers, homework) to its function: “the bottom line is your bottom line… whether whatever is happening is moving you ahead toward what you really want.”  
   • This keeps the conversation anchored in chosen values and behavioral effectiveness rather than rule-governed compliance.

4. Self-as-context / therapeutic stance  
   • Therapist adopts a “hired hand” stance, modeling self-as-context: “I work for you… I’m not willing to take your thoughts or mine as literally true.”  
   • This stance invites the client to observe thoughts and roles from a transcendent perspective rather than being entangled in them.

5. Present-moment awareness & committed action  
   • The homework itself was intended to increase daily contact with present-moment experience and to link it to committed action.  
   • The session ends with the therapist noting the avoidance pattern without coercion, leaving space for the client to choose a workable next step consistent with personal values.

Overall, the dialogue illustrates the ACT cycle: avoidance and fusion show up, the therapist uses defusion and values clarification to loosen their grip, and the focus returns to workable action in the service of the client’s chosen life direction.
