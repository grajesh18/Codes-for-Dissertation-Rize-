“Between now and next time, notice one moment you’re tempted to shove the feeling down or out-run it. Instead of fixing it, pause, name it (‘here’s anger,’ ‘here’s shame’), and ask: ‘If I stop arguing with this for 5 seconds, what tiny move toward the person I want to be becomes possible?’ Do it or don’t—just watch what happens and bring the story to our next session.”
