      "\n",
      "Across these sessions, the therapist consistently employs core Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) processes to foster psychological flexibility and support the client in relating differently to their internal experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Acceptance vs. Avoidance:**  \n",
      "The client demonstrates a strong tendency toward experiential avoidance, expressing reluctance to engage with difficult emotions, both in and out of session (e.g., avoiding homework, wanting to “push down” or “dissipate” anger, and discomfort with feeling emotions physically). The therapist normalizes this resistance, framing it as a natural part of the process and inviting the client to notice and accept their own ambivalence rather than struggle against it. Through metaphors (such as the “war zone” and the chessboard), the therapist gently highlights the futility of ongoing attempts to control or eliminate unwanted thoughts and feelings, instead encouraging an attitude of openness and willingness to experience discomfort as part of a meaningful life.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cognitive Defusion:**  \n",
      "The client often fuses with unhelpful thoughts and beliefs (e.g., “emotion is not a productive state,” “numbers are not trustworthy,” or “self-assessment is unreliable”), treating them as literal truths that must dictate behavior. The therapist repeatedly models and invites cognitive defusion—stepping back from thoughts and seeing them as mental events rather than facts. Through metaphor and direct dialogue, the therapist helps the client notice the process of thinking itself, rather than getting caught up in the content, and emphasizes workability over rightness or wrongness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Contact with the Present Moment (Mindfulness):**  \n",
      "The client tends to dwell on past experiences, future consequences, or theoretical discussions, often missing direct contact with current experience. The therapist consistently redirects attention to the here-and-now, sometimes through experiential exercises, and encourages the client to observe thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations as they arise, without judgment or the need to change them. This mindful awareness is presented as a way to gather “raw data” about experience, rather than becoming entangled in evaluation or avoidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Self-as-Context (The Observing Self):**  \n",
      "A recurring theme is helping the client access the “observing self”—the stable, aware perspective from which thoughts, feelings, and memories can be noticed without being defining. The therapist uses metaphors (the chessboard, the table, the observer outside the “war zone”) and direct inquiry to help the client distinguish between the self that experiences internal events and the self that observes them. This process is challenging for the client, who often oscillates between conceptualizing and directly experiencing this perspective, but the therapist supports this exploration with patience and curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Values and Workability:**  \n",
      "While values work is sometimes implicit, the therapist frequently brings the conversation back to what truly matters to the client, emphasizing that meaningful action should be guided by values rather than by the avoidance of discomfort. The therapist frames the client as “the boss,” highlighting their agency and the importance of clarifying what they want their life to stand for. The therapist also questions the workability of the client’s current strategies, inviting reflection on whether these approaches move the client toward or away from their desired life.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Committed Action:**  \n",
      "Although the main focus in these segments is on foundational processes (acceptance, defusion, self-as-context), the therapist gently encourages the client to consider the potential benefits of engaging with difficult experiences (e.g., through homework or in-session exercises) in service of their values. The groundwork is being laid for future committed action, with the therapist tying behavioral experiments and new responses to the client’s deeper motivations and desired outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary Statement:**  \n",
      "Overall, these sessions exemplify ACT’s integrative approach: the therapist uses metaphor, experiential exercises, and compassionate dialogue to help the client notice and accept their internal experiences, disentangle from unhelpful thoughts, contact the present moment, and access a broader sense of self. The therapist persistently orients the work toward values and\n"
