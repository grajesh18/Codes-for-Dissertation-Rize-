Therapy Session: struggles with avoidance of emotions, fusion with thoughts, and resistance to change
T: Sarah, I'm glad you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you to therapy at this point in your life?
C: Honestly, I'm just feeling stuck. I've been feeling anxious and overwhelmed lately, and I don't know how to stop it.
T: It sounds like you're struggling with some difficult emotions [acceptance]. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "stuck"?
C: I feel like I'm just going through the motions of life, but I'm not really living. I'm avoiding things that make me feel uncomfortable or anxious, and I feel like I'm losing touch with myself.
T: That makes sense. It sounds like you're using avoidance as a coping mechanism [avoidance]. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "losing touch with yourself"?

T: It sounds like you're struggling with fusion [fusion] with your thoughts and feelings. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "saying yes to things I don't really want to do"?
C: I don't know, it's just that I feel like I'm people-pleasing or something. I'm trying to avoid conflict or rejection, so I just go along with what other people want.

C: I just feel like if I say no or disagree with someone, they'll get upset or angry with me. And I don't want to deal with that.
T: It sounds like you're worried about what others will think or feel [fusion]. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "I don't want to deal with that"?
C: I just feel like I'm not strong enough to handle conflict or rejection. I feel like I'll get hurt or damaged in some way.
T: It sounds like you're struggling with feelings of vulnerability and inadequacy [acceptance]. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "I'm not strong enough"?

T: It sounds like you're feeling like you're living in a role or a persona, rather than being yourself [self-as-context]. Can you tell me more about what you mean by "pretending to be someone I'm not"?
C: I just feel like I'm trying to fit in or please others, rather than being true to myself.
