      "T: Hi Sarah, thanks for coming in today. I know we talked a little bit last time about anger and self-criticism being tough for you lately. To start, could you tell me a bit about what’s been coming up for you this week? Maybe a moment when these feelings or thoughts felt especially strong?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Yeah, sure. I actually had an argument with my partner two days ago. It started out small, but I got so angry so quickly. Afterward, I kept replaying the whole thing in my head and criticizing myself—like, \"Why can’t you just control yourself?\" or \"What’s wrong with you?\" It’s like I can’t shut off that critical voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That sounds really painful, Sarah. When you notice that critical voice getting loud after an argument like that, what do you usually do next? Do you try to push those thoughts away, or do they sort of take over? [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Most of the time, I try to distract myself or tell myself to just stop thinking about it. But honestly, it doesn’t work; the thoughts just get louder. Sometimes I’ll go for a walk or watch TV, but the self-criticism is still there in the background. It’s exhausting.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It makes sense that you’d want to escape those thoughts, especially when they’re so harsh. [avoidance] If you pause for a second and just notice that critical voice, almost like you’re listening to a radio in the next room, what do you hear it saying most often?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Mostly it says things like, \"You’re too much. You’re going to ruin your relationship. No one else gets this angry.\" It just keeps repeating those things over and over. Sometimes it even brings up things from years ago, like mistakes I made in college or with my family.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a lot to carry around. [defusion] When you notice those old mistakes coming up, does it feel like you’re reliving them, or more like they’re stories your mind is telling you about yourself?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It feels like both, honestly. Sometimes it’s like I’m right back in those situations, feeling embarrassed or ashamed. Other times, it’s just this running commentary about how I’m failing or not good enough. I feel like I can never escape it.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s really tough, Sarah. Our minds can be relentless with these stories. [defusion] If you imagine that critical voice as a separate part of you—like a commentator or a character—what would it look or sound like?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Hm, I guess it would be kind of harsh, maybe like a strict teacher or a disappointed parent. It’s always disappointed, always expecting more. I can almost picture it standing over me, arms crossed, shaking its head.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a vivid image. Sometimes, when we see that voice as just one part of us—not the whole story—it can loosen its grip a bit. [defusion] If you were to thank this “strict teacher” for trying to help or protect you, what do you imagine it would say back?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That feels weird, but I guess it would say it’s trying to keep me from messing up again. Maybe it thinks if I’m hard enough on myself, I’ll finally change. But honestly, it just makes me feel stuck and ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It sounds like that inner critic is trying to protect you in its own way, even if it’s not very gentle. [self-as-context] When you notice that stuck feeling, what do you usually do in response? Do you try to argue with it, or do you find yourself avoiding situations where it might show up?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I usually avoid things, especially if I think I might get angry or mess up again. Like, I’ll avoid talking about certain topics with my partner or just withdraw altogether. Sometimes I’ll even cancel plans with friends if I’m feeling really bad. It’s like I’m afraid of making things worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s understandable, Sarah. Avoidance can feel safer in the short term. [avoidance] But I’m curious, over time, how does this avoidance affect your life and your relationships? Does it help you feel more in control, or does it create new challenges?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: At first, it feels safer. But after a while, I just feel more isolated and frustrated with myself. I notice I’m missing out on things I care about, like connecting with my partner or enjoying time with friends. It’s like I’m trapped in this loop of anger, shame, and avoidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That sounds exhausting. When you think about the things you’re missing out on—those important connections—what does that bring up for you? Are there values or qualities you wish you could bring into your relationships more often? [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I want to be more patient, more loving. I want my partner to feel safe with me, not afraid of my anger. I want to be the kind of friend who shows up, not someone who cancels last minute. I just feel like I’m failing at all of that right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It sounds like kindness, patience, and connection are really important to you. [values] When you’re caught in that self-critical loop, does it pull you further away from those values, or is there still a part of you that holds onto them?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: The criticism definitely pulls me away. I get so focused on what I’m doing wrong that I forget what I actually want to do or how I want to show up. Sometimes I feel like I’m just reacting all the time instead of choosing.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s an important observation. Sometimes, our mind’s attempts to control or criticize can take us further from the life we want to live. [control vs. workability] If you imagine letting go of the struggle to control or silence your thoughts, what do you think might happen? Would it open up space for something new?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’m not sure. Part of me is afraid that if I stop trying to control my anger or those thoughts, things will get worse. Like, I’ll say or do something I regret. But another part of me wonders if it would be a relief to just let the thoughts be there and focus on what matters instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a really honest answer. The urge to control difficult thoughts and feelings is so common, but sometimes it keeps us stuck. [acceptance] Would you be willing to try a brief exercise with me right now? We can practice noticing a difficult thought without trying to change or control it, just to see what that’s like.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Okay, I’ll try. What do I need to do?\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Great. Let’s start by closing your eyes, if that feels comfortable, and bringing to mind one of those harsh self-critical thoughts. Maybe something like, “I’m too much.” Notice the thought in your mind, and see if you can observe it as just words or a story—almost like a cloud passing through the sky. [defusion] What do you notice as you do that?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I feel tense at first, like I want to push it away. But when I just watch it, it’s a little less overwhelming. It’s still there, but maybe not as loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a powerful observation. Often, when we allow thoughts to just be there, they start to lose some of their intensity. [acceptance] If you let the thought “I’m too much” hang around in the background, what else do you notice in your body or mind?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: My chest feels tight, and my stomach is kind of knotted. I also notice a little sadness, maybe because I’ve believed this thought for so long. But there’s also a tiny bit of relief, like I don’t have to fight it right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Thank you for sharing that. That relief is important—it shows us there’s another way to relate to painful thoughts. [acceptance] How does it feel to know you can let the thought be there, without having to buy into it or fight with it?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It feels strange, honestly. Like I’m not used to just letting it be. But it also feels freeing, even if it’s just a small shift. I guess I didn’t realize how much energy I spend fighting my own mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a really meaningful insight, Sarah. Fighting with your mind is exhausting. [control vs. workability] If you spent less energy on that struggle, what would you want to do with that energy instead? Are there actions or relationships you’d want to invest in?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’d want to try to reconnect with my partner, maybe talk things through without so much fear. I’d want to show up for my friends, even if I’m feeling rough. I think I’d also want to start being kinder to myself, instead of always tearing myself down.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those sound like beautiful intentions. [values, committed-action] Moving toward kindness and connection, even when your mind is being critical, is a really brave step. What do you imagine would be the smallest action you could take this week that aligns with your values, even if self-criticism shows up?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe I could send a text to my partner, just letting them know I care. Or I could reach out to a friend and make plans, even if I’m nervous. I could also try to notice when I’m being hard on myself and remind myself it’s just a thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those are wonderful ideas, Sarah. Even small steps can make a big difference. [committed-action] If those critical thoughts or feelings of anger show up while you’re reaching out, how might you handle them differently, based on what we practiced today?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I guess I could try to notice them, but not let them decide what I do. Like, “Oh, there’s that thought again,” but still send the text anyway. I could remind myself that my values matter more than the voice in my head.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a powerful way to put it. [defusion, values] Your values can guide you, even when difficult thoughts or feelings are along for the ride. On a tough day, what might help you remember to pause and notice the critic, instead of getting swept up in it?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe I could set a reminder on my phone, or write a note to myself. Something simple like, “Notice the story.” I think it would help to have something to bring me back when I’m caught up in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a great strategy. Sometimes, even a gentle reminder can help us step back and see thoughts as just thoughts. [present-moment, defusion] When you practice this, you might find it easier to catch yourself before you go down the self-criticism spiral. How does it feel to imagine yourself doing this in your daily life?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It feels hopeful, actually. Like maybe I don’t have to be at war with myself all the time. I know it’ll be hard, but I want to try. I want to see what’s possible if I don’t let those thoughts run my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That hope is really important, Sarah. It shows that you’re open to new possibilities, even in the face of discomfort. [acceptance, committed-action] When you notice anger or self-criticism bubbling up, what could you say to yourself in those moments to support your values, rather than your old patterns?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe I could say, “It’s okay to feel this. I don’t have to act on it.” Or, “This thought isn’t in charge of me.” I could try to remind myself of the kind of person I want to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those are compassionate and empowering statements. [values, self-as-context] Sometimes, bringing in a little kindness can help soften the critic’s impact. If you imagine offering yourself the same understanding you’d give to a close friend, how might that change things?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I think I’d be less harsh. I’d probably tell my friend that it’s normal to mess up or feel angry sometimes, and that it doesn’t mean they’re a bad person. I’d want them to know they’re still loved. I guess I could try saying those things to myself, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a wonderful practice, Sarah. Treating yourself as you would a friend can create space for healing. [acceptance] Even if the critic pipes up, you can gently acknowledge it and choose how you want to respond. What do you most want to remember from today’s session when things get hard?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I want to remember that I don’t have to fight my thoughts all the time. That I can notice them and still choose what matters to me. And that it’s okay to be kind to myself, even when I’m struggling.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those are powerful takeaways. [present-moment, values] Before we wrap up today, is there anything else you’d like to talk about, or any questions about what we explored?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I guess I just want to know if it really gets easier. Like, does the critic ever go away, or do you just learn to live with it?\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a great question. For most people, the critic doesn’t disappear completely, but with practice, its voice gets less controlling. [acceptance, defusion] You learn to recognize it as just one part of your experience—not the whole truth. Over time, it can feel less like a bully and more like background noise.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That gives me some hope. I want to keep practicing what we talked about. I know it won’t be perfect, but I think I can do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: I believe in you, Sarah. Each step you take toward your values—even small ones—matters. [committed-action, values] We can keep exploring these skills together, and I’ll support you along the way. Thanks for your openness and courage today.\n",

      "We are creating a continuous ACT therapy session transcript between therapist (T) and client Sarah (C). The topic is Sarah's struggles with anger, self-criticism, and control of painful thoughts. We are to produce 30-40 exchanges, about 8000 words, with each turn having 3-5 sentences. We must use ACT process tags (e.g., [defusion], [values]) appropriately and alternate between T and C. The conversation must be natural and exploratory.\n",

      "\n",
      "C: Honestly, it’s been rough. I snapped at my partner again yesterday over something trivial, and now this voice in my head won’t stop calling me a terrible person. I just want to crush those thoughts—they make me feel so out of control. \n",
      "\n",
      "T: That sounds incredibly painful, carrying both the anger and that harsh self-judgment. When you try to crush the thoughts, what happens? Does it create space or more struggle? [workability, defusion] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: More struggle—like I’m wrestling with myself. The angrier I get at my own mind, the louder the criticism gets. It’s exhausting. I just want peace. \n",
      "\n",
      "T: Peace is a beautiful longing. Could we explore what \"peace\" looks like for you? Not as the absence of anger or thoughts, but as a way of being present with them without the wrestling? [acceptance, values] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe... peace would feel like not being hijacked by rage when someone cuts me off in traffic, or not believing I’m defective when I make a mistake. Right now, it’s like I’m fused with every critical thought. [fusion] \n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly—that fusion is like being tangled in barbed wire. What if we practiced noticing the thoughts as separate from you? Like clouds passing, not truths. [defusion, self-as-context] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’ve tried mindfulness apps, but when the anger surges, it’s physical—my chest tightens, and I lash out. Then the shame floods in. How can I observe that? \n",
      "\n",
      "T: By gently making room for it. Anger isn’t the enemy—it’s a signal. What if instead of fighting it, you acknowledged it with curiosity? \"Ah, there’s tension; what’s it trying to tell me?\" [acceptance, present-moment] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: It tells me I’m failing—at work, relationships, everything. The thought \"I’m not enough\" plays on loop. \n",
      "\n",
      "T: And when that loop runs, what do you typically do? Distract? Argue with it? [avoidance] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: Both! I’ll binge shows or argue back: \"No, I am enough!\" But it’s useless. The thoughts always win. \n",
      "\n",
      "T: Because fighting them gives them power. What if we tested workability? Has battling this thought for years brought you closer to the life you want? [workability] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: ...No. It keeps me small. I avoid social things because I might snap, or I’m too drained from the inner war. \n",
      "\n",
      "T: What does \"small\" cost you? What values are buried under this struggle? [values] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: Connection—I miss laughing with friends. And creativity; I used to paint, but now I’m too busy managing my mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "T: So beneath the anger and self-criticism is a deep care for relationships and self-expression. What if we unhooked from the thoughts not to feel better, but to make room for painting or calling a friend? [committed-action, defusion] \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "C: I just feel like I'm stuck in this pattern of anger and self-doubt. I get so frustrated with myself when I mess up, and it's like I'm constantly fighting this inner critic that just won't shut up. I feel like I'm losing control, and it's affecting my relationships and my work.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of emotional distress. Can you tell me more about what it's like to be with this inner critic? Is it like a voice in your head, or is it a more general feeling?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Yeah, it's definitely a voice. It's like this constant narrator that's always judging me and telling me I'm not good enough. It's exhausting, and it makes me feel so small and powerless.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: I can imagine. It sounds like this voice is quite aversive [avoidance] for you. Have you ever tried to silence it or tell it to shut up?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: (laughs) Yeah, I've tried to push it away, or distract myself with work or other things. But it always comes back, and it's like it's more powerful than I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That can be really demoralizing. It's like you're trying to control something that feels uncontrollable. Can you tell me more about what you value in life? What's most important to you?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I guess I value being happy and at peace. I want to be able to enjoy my relationships and my work without this constant feeling of anxiety and self-doubt. I want to feel like I'm living a meaningful life.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That's a great start. It sounds like you're looking for a sense of workability [control vs. workability] in your life, rather than just trying to control your emotions. Can you see how that might be a different approach to dealing with your inner critic?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I think so. I mean, if I'm focusing on what I value, rather than trying to control my emotions, that might be a more sustainable way to live.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly. And it's not about getting rid of the inner critic completely, but about being able to observe it when it arises, and choose how you want to respond. Can you think of a time when you were able to do that, even if it was just for a moment?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: (pauses) Yeah, I think so. There was one time when I was feeling really anxious and self-critical, but I remembered that I had a meeting with a friend later that day, and I wanted to enjoy that time with her. So I took a few deep breaths, and I told myself that I could handle whatever emotions came up, and that I could still have a good time with my friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That's a great example of observing your thoughts and choosing how to respond. It sounds like you were able to cultivate some acceptance [acceptance] in that moment. Can you tell me more about what that was like?\n",

      "T: That's beautiful. And it's not about avoiding your emotions or suppressing them, but about being able to observe them and choose how you want to engage with them. Can you see how that might be a more sustainable way to live, rather than trying to control your emotions?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Yeah, I think so. It's like, I can still feel anxious or self-critical, but I don't have to be controlled by those emotions. I can choose how I want to respond.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly. And it's not about being perfect or never feeling those emotions again, but about being able to live a life that's in line with your values, even when it's hard. Can you think of any areas in your life where you'd like to make some changes, and start living more in line with your values?\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "C: (pauses) Yeah, I think so. There was one time when I made a big mistake at work, and I was really hard on myself about it. But in the end, I was able to learn from it and move forward in a way that was more in line with my values.\n",

      "\n",
      "C: (pauses) Yeah, I think so. I could start by being more gentle with myself, and reminding myself that I'm doing the best I can. I could also try to practice some self-care, like taking care of my physical health and getting enough sleep.\n",

I think we've made some great progress in terms of exploring your values and identifying some areas where you'd like to make some changes. Do you have any questions or anything else you'd like to discuss before we wrap up?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: (pauses) Yeah, actually, I do. I was wondering if there's any way to deal with the inner critic that's still really loud in my head. It's hard to just ignore it or tell it to shut up.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That's a great question. While it's not possible to completely eliminate the inner critic, there are some strategies that might help you work with it more effectively. One approach is to practice defusion [defusion] techniques, such as noticing when the critic is speaking and observing it without judgment. You can also try to reframe the critic's messages in a more compassionate and realistic light. It might be helpful to work on building your self-compassion and self-kindness, and to remind yourself that you're doing the best you can.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That makes sense. I can try to work on that.\n",

I think we've made some great progress, and I'm excited to see how you'll continue to grow and develop in the coming weeks and months. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like to say or any final thoughts you'd like to share?\n",

      "C: Thanks. I guess I’m exhausted from trying to keep a lid on my anger and then beating myself up when the lid pops off. I snap at my kids, replay the scene all night, and promise I’ll be “better” tomorrow, but the same cycle repeats. I’m terrified I’m becoming the parent I swore I’d never be. Deep down I just want to be calm and connected with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It makes sense that you’re exhausted—fighting your own emotions and then attacking yourself for having them is like running two marathons at once. [defusion] When you say “keep a lid on,” it sounds like there’s a belief that anger must be contained or else something catastrophic will happen. Can we slow it down and notice what shows up in your body right now as you describe that fear? [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: My chest feels tight, like someone cinched a belt around my ribs. There’s heat in my throat, and my mind flashes to yesterday when my six-year-old spilled juice on the couch and I screamed “Why can’t you be careful!” His little face crumpled, and I hated myself instantly. I can feel the shame pooling in my stomach like cold oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Thank you for staying with those sensations. [acceptance] That tight chest and hot throat are data, not directives. I wonder if we could treat them like weather passing through—uncomfortable, yes, but not requiring an emergency lockdown. What does the angry voice in your head say in that exact moment before you scream?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It hisses, “He’s ruining everything, you’ll never have nice things, you’re failing as a mom.” Then another voice jumps in: “Nice moms don’t yell, you’re such a bitch.” They’re rapid-fire, like dueling narrators, and I’m stuck in the crossfire.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: So on one side there’s the “protector” voice trying to prevent loss or chaos, and on the other the “critic” voice trying to punish you for not meeting an impossible standard. [fusion] Both sound so convincing that you fuse with them—becoming the anger, becoming the failure—rather than noticing you’re the person hearing them. What happens if we just label them: “I notice I’m having the thought that he’s ruining everything” and “I notice I’m having the thought that I’m a bitch”? [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It feels… weirdly lighter. Like I stepped back half an inch. But I’m scared if I step back too far I’ll lose control and really explode. The critic says that distance is just laziness, letting myself off the hook.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s the critic’s job—to keep you fused so you’ll keep striving. [avoidance] Ironically, the more we try to control or suppress anger, the more it builds pressure like a shaken soda. What if the goal isn’t to control the anger but to relate to it differently, so it doesn’t drive your parenting bus? [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Relating differently how? I’ve tried counting to ten, deep breathing, but in the moment it’s like my prefrontal cortex just evaporates.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those techniques are fine, but they’re still in service of control—getting rid of the feeling. [workability] Let’s test something smaller first. Could you be willing to have that heat and tightness without needing them to go away, just long enough to choose an action aligned with the mom you want to be? [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I want to say yes, but willingness feels like agreeing to let a tornado stay in the living room. What if it wrecks everything?\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Great image—tornado in the living room. [metaphor] A tornado is powerful, but notice you’re not the tornado; you’re the sky it moves through. The sky doesn’t have to like the tornado, just give it room to pass. If the tornado could talk, what does your anger need you to hear?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It says, “I’m overwhelmed, I have no help, I’m terrified I’ll always be alone in this.” When I say it out loud, my eyes sting. That’s… not what I expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Under the anger is grief and fear—totally human stuff. [self-as-context] The critic tries to shut that down because it fears vulnerability will make you weak. But what if acknowledging overwhelm is actually the gateway to connection with your kids rather than disconnection?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Connection sounds good, but I don’t know how to get there when my nervous system is screaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Let’s anchor in the present. Feel your feet on the floor, the temperature of the air on your skin. [present-moment] From this grounded place, can you recall a moment, even tiny, when you felt warmth toward your kids this week?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Yesterday my daughter crawled into my lap while I was working and said, “Mommy, your heartbeat is my favorite song.” I softened for a second, then the critic jumped in: “Enjoy it while it lasts before you ruin her too.”\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That softening is your values speaking—love, presence, nurturing. [values] The critic tries to hijack it with a threat, but the fact that you noticed the warmth means it’s still alive in you. What would you want your daughter to remember about you when she’s grown?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That I was safe, that she could come to me with anything, that I saw who she really was and loved her anyway. My throat’s tight again saying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful. That’s a compass, not a destination we arrive at perfectly. [committed-action] Every time anger shows up, you have a choice: serve the critic’s agenda of suppression and shame, or serve the mom you want to be. Both are hard; which hard do you choose?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I choose the mom I want to be, but I need a plan for when the heat rises.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Let’s build a tiny experiment. Next time you feel the belt around your chest, could you silently say, “Hello, old friend, I see you’re scared,” and place a hand on your heart—just as an act of kindness to yourself, not to make it go away? [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I can try. The critic will call it cheesy, but I’ll try.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Good. And if the critic pipes up, we can thank it for its opinion—“Thanks, mind”—and return to the experiment. [defusion] We’re not asking the anger to vanish; we’re practicing giving it room so your values can steer.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: What if I still yell?\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Then we practice repair. You go to your son and say, “I got overwhelmed and spoke harshly; that’s on me. I’m working on staying kind even when I’m upset.” Repair is values in motion. [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That feels terrifying but also… relieving. Like I don’t have to be perfect, just accountable.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly. Perfection is the critic’s mirage; accountability is the path. [values] How does your body feel right now talking about repair instead of perfection?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Shoulders dropped a little. There’s still a knot in my gut, but it’s looser, like it has permission to be there without defining me.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Notice that shift. [present-moment] The knot isn’t the enemy; it’s a signal you care. Caring is the fuel for change, not the obstacle.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I never thought of it that way. I’ve been treating my caring like a weakness the critic needs to whip into shape.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Let’s turn the whip into a compass. [metaphor] If your caring could speak directly to the critic, what would it say?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: “Back off, I’ve got this. Your panic isn’t helping me parent.” I feel a spark of protectiveness toward myself, which is new.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That spark is the self-as-context—the part of you that can hold both anger and compassion without being either. [self-as-context] Can we rest here for a breath and just feel the spark?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It’s small, like a candle in a windy cave, but it’s steady. I want to cup my hands around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful image. [present-moment] Each time you choose willingness over control, you feed that flame. We have about fifteen minutes left—what feels most important to take from today?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That I don’t have to wait until I’m “fixed” to be the mom my kids need. I can practice small acts of kindness toward my anger and my kids, even when it’s messy.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a powerful commitment. [committed-action] Between now and our next session, would you be willing to track moments when you either serve the critic or serve your values, just as data, no judgment?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Yes. I’ll jot them in my phone notes. And maybe try the hand-on-heart thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Lovely. And remember, every stumble is grist for the mill—evidence you’re in the arena, not on the sidelines. [acceptance] I’m honored you let me witness that candle today.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Thank you. I feel… less alone with it.\n",
