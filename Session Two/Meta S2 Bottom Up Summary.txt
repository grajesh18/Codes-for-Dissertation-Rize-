Therapy Session Summary:

**Client's Emotional State:**
The client appears to be in a relatively calm state during the session, with a brief flare of anger rated as a 4-5 on a 1-10 scale. They seem to be able to manage their emotions and contain them with relatively little effort. However, there is a sense of underlying frustration and possibly a feeling of being stuck in a pattern of behavior that they've been trying to change for a long time.

**Main Issues Discussed:**
The main issues discussed during the session are the client's experience of depression and anger, their efforts to regulate and manage these emotions, and their overall workability of living with this pattern. The client also touches on their tendency to avoid dealing with negative emotions and thoughts, instead choosing to put on an "emotional damper" and deal with them later.

**Therapeutic Themes or Metaphors Used:**
The therapist uses a metaphor of three scales to help the client rate their emotions and efforts to regulate them. The client also uses a metaphor of a "brief flare" to describe their anger, which suggests that they are trying to defuse and observe their emotions rather than becoming overly attached to them.

**Possible Directions for Therapy:**
Based on this session, possible directions for therapy could include:

1. Further exploration of the client's pattern of behavior and how it affects their daily life.
2. Developing strategies for dealing with negative emotions and thoughts in the present moment, rather than avoiding them.
3. Working on increasing the client's self-awareness and ability to observe their thoughts and emotions without becoming overly attached to them.
4. Examining the client's tendency to put on an "emotional damper" and exploring alternative ways of managing their emotions.
5. Helping the client to develop a greater sense of workability and fulfillment in their life, rather than just trying to avoid or suppress their negative emotions.
