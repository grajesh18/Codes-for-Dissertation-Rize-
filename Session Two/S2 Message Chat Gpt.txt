"Remember, it's okay to feel pain and frustration; they are part of being human. Instead of trying to control these feelings, try to make space for them. When they arise, observe them as if you’re watching clouds pass by in the sky. This practice of acceptance can help you respond in ways that align with your values and lead to a more meaningful life. You have the strength to navigate through this."
