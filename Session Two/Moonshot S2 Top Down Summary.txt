ACT-Informed Summary:

ACT Principles Reflected in Session Two

1. Present-Moment Awareness & Functional Assessment  
   • The therapist begins with a moment-by-moment “picture of what things are like for you,” using three 1–10 scales to anchor the client in concrete, recent experience rather than abstract stories.  
   • This is classic ACT behavioral tracking—observing the form (anger 4–5) and the function (effort to control 2–3) of private events in real time.

2. Cognitive Defusion & Self-as-Context  
   • When the client says, “The back of my mind is working,” he is noticing thoughts as ongoing mental processes rather than literal truths.  
   • This brief meta-cognitive observation loosens fusion with the thought-content (“he should know better”) and contacts the observing self—the stable perspective from which thoughts are seen in flight.

3. Experiential Avoidance Detected  
   • The client’s strategy: “let it flare… then put an emotional damper on it… deal with this later and fix it” is identified as avoidance.  
   • The therapist labels it “workability,” inviting the client to examine whether this pattern moves him toward or away from valued living.

4. Workability & Values Clarification (nascent)  
   • The third scale—“if your life was like this continuously, how workable…?”—directly applies ACT’s pragmatic criterion: Is the behavior serving the client’s chosen values?  
   • The client’s “yes and no” signals the beginning of values clarification: the current strategy has short-term relief but long-term costs.

5. Psychological Flexibility Targeted  
   • By mapping intensity, control effort, and workability, the session sets the stage for increasing flexibility: less struggle with the emotional flare, more willingness to stay present with it, and more committed action aligned with chosen values.

In short, the therapist is using ACT-style functional analysis (present-moment tracking, defusion, self-as-context) to illuminate experiential avoidance and low workability, thereby opening the door to acceptance and values-based action.
