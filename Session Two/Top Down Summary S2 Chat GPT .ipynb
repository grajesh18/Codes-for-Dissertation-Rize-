      "**ACT-Informed Session Summary**\n",
      "\n",
      "Throughout these therapy sessions, the therapist skillfully employs core Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) processes to foster the client’s psychological flexibility and movement toward a more values-driven life. Several ACT principles are woven throughout the client’s experiences and the therapist’s interventions:\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Cognitive Defusion**\n",
      "The client increasingly notices and describes their thoughts and feelings as transient mental events (“a brief flare of anger,” “the back of my mind is working”), rather than absolute truths or defining features of the self. The therapist reinforces this process by using metaphors (e.g., “sitting close to the screen” vs. “sitting back,” the “Mary had a little…” exercise) and experiential exercises that help the client step back from unhelpful thought patterns. This encourages the client to observe thoughts as automatic, learned responses rather than literal instructions that must be followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Acceptance (vs. Experiential Avoidance)**\n",
      "A central theme is the client’s longstanding struggle to control, suppress, or avoid unwanted internal experiences. The therapist gently highlights the futility and paradox of these control strategies, using metaphors and experiential demonstrations (e.g., the paper struggle exercise) to illustrate how efforts to avoid or eliminate pain often intensify it. The client begins to recognize the limits of avoidance (“my distraction stuff is working very well, but long-term? I don’t know…”) and expresses a desire to relate differently to their emotions—moving toward greater willingness and openness to experience discomfort without unnecessary struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Contact with the Present Moment**\n",
      "Both therapist and client repeatedly return to present-moment awareness. The therapist invites the client to notice what is happening “right here, now,” and to trust their own immediate experience rather than getting lost in conceptualizations or past/future worries. This mindful attention helps ground the client in the here-and-now and supports the development of new, more flexible responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Self-as-Context (The Observing Self)**\n",
      "The client demonstrates growing meta-cognitive awareness, describing their own patterns (“I do sort of put on a show,” “I’m on that merry-go-round again”) and beginning to see themselves as the observer of thoughts and feelings rather than being defined by them. The therapist reinforces this distinction between the “operator” and the “readout screen,” helping the client cultivate a sense of self that is distinct from the content of their mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Values Clarification**\n",
      "Emerging throughout the sessions is the client’s desire to live a more authentic and meaningful life (“I want to be a better person,” “find something in me that is honorable,” “expand rather than squash my experience”). The therapist supports this process by asking about the purpose and direction of the client’s actions (“What’s the goal?” “In the service of what?”), helping the client reflect on whether their behaviors are moving them toward or away from what matters most.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Committed Action**\n",
      "While not yet the primary focus, the groundwork for committed, values-based action is being laid. The client’s growing awareness of the unworkability of avoidance and control strategies, coupled with their desire for change, sets the stage for future steps toward meaningful action—even in the presence of discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. **Workability and Creative Hopelessness**\n",
      "A key ACT theme is highlighted as the therapist and client explore whether current strategies are effective in creating a rich, full life. The therapist introduces the concept of “workability” and “creative hopelessness,” helping the client see that the agenda of control may itself be the problem, and that letting go of unworkable strategies can open the door to new possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. **Functional Contextualism**\n",
      "Throughout, the therapist frames thoughts, feelings,\n"
