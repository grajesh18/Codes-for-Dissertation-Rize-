Therapy Session Summary:

Emotional state  
The client presents as reflective and articulate, with low-to-moderate baseline distress. Anger appears in brief “flares” (rated 4–5/10) that quickly subside; the client is not overwhelmed but is vigilant about keeping these surges contained.

Main issues discussed  
1. Regulation of anger and self-criticism: the client’s primary strategy is to let the emotion spike, then suppress or “put an emotional damper on it” until a later, more convenient time.  
2. Chronic avoidance: postponing deeper processing (“I’ll deal with this later and fix it”) has become habitual and is acknowledged as “not workable” in the long run.  
3. Workability gap: although the client’s current method prevents immediate escalation, it does not move life in a valued direction.

Therapeutic themes / metaphors  
- Three ACT-style scales (intensity, struggle, workability) introduced to operationalize the problem.  
- “Emotional damper” and “flare-up then die-down” as metaphors for the client’s avoidance cycle.  
- Therapist’s gentle highlighting of defusion/self-as-context (“the back of my mind is working”) to begin loosening attachment to thoughts.

Possible directions for therapy  
- Expand awareness of the short- and long-term costs of the “flare-dampen-postpone” pattern.  
- Introduce mindfulness and acceptance skills so the client can stay with anger/criticism without immediate suppression.  
- Clarify core values to test whether current emotional regulation strategies serve those values.  
- Begin experiential exercises (e.g., noticing urges to dampen emotions and choosing alternative responses) to increase psychological flexibility.
