ACT-Informed Summary:

The therapy session reflects several ACT principles:

1. **Cognitive Defusion**: The client is learning to observe their thoughts and emotions in the present moment, rather than becoming entangled with them. This is evident when the client says, "The back of my mind is working" and acknowledges that their thoughts are just mental processes in flight. This is a defusion move that decreases attachment to the self.

2. **Acceptance**: The client is attempting to accept their negative emotions, rather than trying to control or avoid them. When discussing their anger, the client rates it as a 4-5 and acknowledges that it's a brief flare that goes down quickly. This suggests that the client is starting to accept their emotions as they arise, rather than trying to suppress or deny them.

3. **Contact with the Present Moment**: The client is learning to be present with their emotions and thoughts, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. When discussing their anger, the client describes it as a brief flare that goes down quickly, indicating that they are able to observe their emotions in the present moment.

4. **Values**: The client is starting to explore what is most important to them and how they want to live their life. When discussing their workability scale, the client says, "yes and no" when asked if their current pattern of dealing with negative emotions is something that leads them in the direction they want to go. This suggests that the client is starting to question whether their current approach is aligned with their values.

5. **Committed Action**: The client is starting to take action towards changing their behavior and developing more effective coping strategies. When discussing their workability scale, the client says that they will "try to work out a solution to why this happened and how I can prevent it in the future." This suggests that the client is committed to taking action towards changing their behavior and developing more effective coping strategies.

6. **The Observing Self**: The client is starting to develop a sense of themselves as the observer of their thoughts and emotions, rather than becoming identified with them. When discussing their anger, the client says, "The back of my mind is working" and acknowledges that their thoughts are just mental processes in flight. This suggests that the client is starting to develop a sense of themselves as the observer of their thoughts and emotions.

7. **Avoidance**: The client is struggling with avoidance, as evident when they say, "If I need to examine this later, I will. I will try to work out a solution to why this happened and how I can prevent it in the future." This suggests that the client is still struggling with avoidance and is not yet able to take action in the present moment.

8. **Fusion**: The client is still struggling with fusion, as evident when they say, "I let it die down and then put an emotional damper on it because it's getting in the way." This suggests that the client is still struggling with becoming entangled with their thoughts and emotions, rather than observing them in the present moment.
