"Remember, pain is a normal part of life. Instead of avoiding it, try to make space for it. This week, notice when uncomfortable emotions arise and practice accepting them without judgment. Reflect on how you can respond in a way that aligns with your values, even in the presence of discomfort. You're building a meaningful life, one step at a time."
