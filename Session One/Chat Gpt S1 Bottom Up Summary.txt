**Summary of Therapy Session**

**Client’s Emotional State:**
The client appears to be experiencing a complex mix of emotions, primarily characterized by depression, anxiety, and anger. There is a sense of frustration and helplessness, particularly around the inability to control these emotions. The client also expresses a degree of skepticism and confusion about the therapeutic process, coupled with a willingness to explore new approaches, albeit with some discomfort and apprehension.

**Main Issues Discussed:**
1. **Depression and Anxiety:** The client has a long history of depression dating back to adolescence, with anxiety manifesting as social anxiety and occasional panic. The client feels a sense of failure in controlling these emotions.
2. **Anger Management:** Anger is identified as a significant issue, particularly in professional settings, where it disrupts the client's ability to focus and enjoy activities. The client perceives anger as something controllable but struggles with its impact on relationships and work.
3. **Emotional Avoidance:** There is a pattern of avoiding negative emotions and thoughts, often by retreating into the mind to rationalize or suppress feelings.
4. **Interpersonal Relationships:** The client’s anger and expectations have affected personal relationships, including a recent breakup, where the client felt their partner was not contributing equally.
5. **Suicidal Thoughts:** The client has experienced suicidal ideation in the past when emotions became unbearable.

**Therapeutic Themes or Metaphors Used:**
1. **Reporter vs. Coach:** The therapist distinguishes between descriptive talk and talk that makes a difference, likening it to the difference between a reporter and a coach.
2. **Sludge in a Glass:** Therapy is compared to cleaning out a glass with sludge at the bottom, suggesting that initial progress might make things seem messier before they get clearer.
3. **Skiing Metaphor:** The client is encouraged to lean into discomfort rather than retreat, akin to leaning forward when skiing down a steep hill.
4. **Shovel in a Hole:** The therapist uses the metaphor of digging a hole with a shovel to illustrate the futility of the client’s current approach to managing emotions.

**Possible Directions for Therapy:**
1. **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):** The therapist hints at using ACT principles, focusing on acceptance rather than control, and exploring the client’s values and how they align with their actions.
2. **Mindfulness and Observation:** The client is encouraged to observe their emotional responses and the urge to control them without immediately acting on these urges.
3. **Exploration of Values:** The client’s values, especially around work and relationships, need clarification to understand the underlying motivations and conflicts.
4. **Reducing Emotional Avoidance:** The client might benefit from learning to stay present with uncomfortable emotions rather than avoiding or suppressing them.
5. **Homework Assignment:** The client is given a task to track their emotions, efforts to change them, and the overall workability of their life to increase awareness and understanding of their emotional patterns.

The session sets the stage for exploring the client’s entrenched cognitive patterns and emotional avoidance, with an emphasis on developing new strategies for dealing with difficult emotions.
