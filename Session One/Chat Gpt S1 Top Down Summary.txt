=== ACT-Informed Final Summary ===

**ACT-Informed Summary of Therapy Sessions**

Across these sessions, the therapeutic process is deeply grounded in the core principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The work reflects an ongoing shift from control and avoidance of internal experiences toward greater openness, awareness, and values-based action.

**1. Creative Hopelessness & Workability**  
The therapist consistently invites the client to notice the unworkability of longstanding strategies aimed at controlling or eliminating difficult emotions such as anger, depression, and anxiety. Through gentle questioning and metaphors (e.g., “winning the war” against emotions, the glass/sludge metaphor, skiing and cliff analogies), the client recognizes that efforts to suppress, avoid, or “fix” internal distress have not led to lasting relief or meaningful change. This “creative hopelessness” is not about inducing despair, but about opening space for new, more flexible approaches—shifting the focus from symptom elimination to what actually works in moving toward a valued life.

**2. Experiential Avoidance and Fusion**  
A prominent theme is the client’s habitual avoidance of painful thoughts and feelings, often inherited from early messages (“stuff your feelings”) or reinforced by workplace and relational contexts. Strategies such as withdrawing, sleeping, “talking himself out of it,” or seeking a “silver bullet” to make feelings stop are explored and gently challenged. The therapist highlights how these avoidance patterns are often fused with rigid, judgmental thoughts—about the self (“there’s something wrong with me”), others (“they don’t care”), and emotions (“I can’t be myself”). These thoughts are experienced as literal truths, driving behavior and reinforcing emotional struggle.

**3. Defusion and Self-as-Context**  
The therapist introduces and models cognitive defusion—helping the client notice thoughts as thoughts, rather than absolute truths or commands. This is facilitated through humor (“Thanks, Mr. Mind!”), metaphors (“using a hammer for a Phillips head”), and explicit invitations to observe the mind’s activity from a distance. The client begins to experiment with stepping back from self-critical or judgmental narratives, and the therapist distinguishes between “reporter” and “coach” modes, subtly introducing self-as-context: the perspective from which one can notice and respond flexibly to internal experiences, rather than being defined by them.

**4. Acceptance and Willingness**  
The therapist repeatedly encourages the client to make space for discomfort and uncertainty, both in therapy and in daily life. Rather than striving to “let go” in the sense of making feelings disappear, the client is invited to allow emotions and thoughts to be present, noticing the urge to control or avoid them, and practicing willingness to experience discomfort in the service of change. The therapist normalizes the difficulty of this stance and validates the client’s fears and confusion, reinforcing that acceptance is a process, not a one-time achievement.

**5. Present-Moment Awareness (Mindfulness)**  
The sessions include explicit attention to the present moment, especially when the client is caught in rumination or over-analysis (e.g., during leisure activities or in social situations). The therapist uses metaphors (e.g., overthinking while skiing) and direct prompts to help the client notice when they are lost in thought versus when they are in contact with immediate experience. Moments of mindful awareness are acknowledged and reinforced, even when they bring confusion or discomfort.

**6. Values Clarification**  
While values are not yet explored in great depth, the groundwork is laid by highlighting how current patterns of avoidance and fusion interfere with what the client cares about—such as connection, authenticity, productivity, and being “worthwhile.” The therapist uses the “miracle question” and explores moments when the client feels most alive or authentic (e.g., being silly with friends, longing for openness with parents), gently pointing toward the possibility of a more values-driven life.

**7. Committed Action and Behavioral Awareness**  
The therapist models a collaborative, flexible approach, inviting the client
