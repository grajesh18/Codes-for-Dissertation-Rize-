      "T: Hi Sarah, I’m glad you made it in today. Before we get started, I want to check in—how are you feeling about having this space to talk right now?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’m a little nervous, to be honest. I know I need to talk about some things, but I also feel embarrassed, like I’m admitting I can’t handle stuff everyone else seems to manage.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Thank you for sharing that—it’s completely normal to feel a bit apprehensive at the start. Just know that however you’re feeling, this is a space where you don’t have to handle things alone. Maybe we can start by talking a little more about what’s been coming up for you lately that feels tough.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I guess the main thing is this constant sense that I’m failing at life. Like, I mess up at work, I don’t keep up with friends, and I’m always behind on things. It just feels like I can’t get anything right, and that feeling is always in the back of my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That sounds incredibly heavy to carry around—almost like you’re walking with this cloud of not-good-enoughness above you all the time. When those thoughts and feelings show up, how do you usually respond to them? [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Most of the time, I try to ignore them or distract myself. I’ll watch TV or scroll through my phone, just anything to not think about it. But it never really goes away; it just comes back later, sometimes even stronger.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It makes sense you’d want to push those feelings away—they’re so painful. And yet, it seems like the more you try to avoid them, the more persistent they become. Have you noticed any patterns about when these thoughts come up strongest? [avoidance] [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Yeah, definitely when I make a mistake, even a small one, or when I see other people doing well. Like, if a friend gets a promotion, I just spiral into this comparison mode. Or if I forget something at work, I’ll obsess over it for days.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That sounds like a really exhausting cycle—messing up, comparing, then feeling even worse. When you say you spiral, what sorts of thoughts run through your mind in those moments? [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It’s like a loop: “You’re such a loser. Why can’t you just get it together? Everyone else does.” I replay mistakes over and over, thinking about how people must see me. I start to believe I’ll never amount to anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those thoughts sound really harsh and judgmental. I wonder if, for a moment, we could pause and notice them as just words your mind is saying, rather than absolute truths. What happens if you say, “I’m having the thought that I’m a failure,” instead of “I am a failure”? [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That feels weird, but...I guess it puts a little distance between me and the thought. Like it’s something happening to me, not the core of who I am. But it’s hard to really believe it’s just a thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That makes a lot of sense—it can feel strange at first. Our minds are wired to sound convincing, especially when we’re feeling vulnerable. Would you be willing to try noticing these thoughts as passing events, maybe like clouds floating in the sky, rather than facts you need to buy into? [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I can try. I like the idea of seeing them as clouds. But sometimes they feel more like storms—big and overwhelming, not just little puffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: I appreciate your honesty—sometimes thoughts are more like storms than clouds. Even so, storms pass eventually, even if they’re intense. When you’re caught in the middle of that mental storm, what do you usually do next? [present-moment] [avoidance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Usually I just shut down. I’ll cancel plans, avoid talking to people, or just zone out in front of the TV for hours. I don’t want anyone to see me like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It sounds like those moments lead you to withdraw, maybe as a way to protect yourself from more pain. Have you noticed what happens to your mood or your sense of connection with others when you pull away like that? [avoidance] [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I end up feeling even more alone. I want comfort, but I also feel like I don’t deserve it. Then I get stuck in this loop where I’m both lonely and ashamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s such a painful place to be—wanting connection but feeling undeserving of it. It’s like the very thing you need feels out of reach. If you imagine who you’d be without these stories about failure, what kind of life or relationships would you want? [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I think I’d want to be more open with my friends, to celebrate their successes without feeling threatened. I’d want to try new things at work instead of always playing it safe. I guess I just want to feel like I’m enough, even if I mess up sometimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those sound like really meaningful wishes—openness, courage, and self-acceptance. Underneath all the pain, it seems like you care deeply about connecting with others and growing as a person. Does that resonate with you? [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Yeah, it does. I wish I could focus on that more, instead of all the ways I think I’m failing. It’s hard to hold onto those values when my brain is shouting at me.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It’s so understandable—those loud, critical thoughts can drown out our values sometimes. But just by naming what matters to you, you’re already taking a step toward living in line with those values. If you imagine taking a tiny step toward one of those wishes, what might that look like? [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe I could reach out to a friend, even if I feel awkward. Or say yes to a project at work, instead of worrying I’ll mess it up. I don’t know, it feels scary, but maybe possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: I really appreciate your willingness to consider that, even though it feels scary. Sometimes, being in touch with our values means making room for discomfort, rather than waiting for it to disappear. How do you feel about the idea of carrying the fear with you, instead of waiting for it to go away before acting? [acceptance] [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I guess I’ve spent so long waiting to not be scared that I never do anything. Maybe if I just accepted that I’ll feel nervous or insecure, I could still do things that matter to me. It’s a new way of thinking for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a really important insight. Acceptance isn’t about liking the discomfort, but about letting it be there while you move toward what matters. If you were to try reaching out to a friend, what thoughts or feelings do you imagine would show up? [acceptance] [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Probably all the usual stuff: “They don’t really like you, you’re bothering them, you’ll say something stupid.” I’d feel anxious and maybe even a little nauseous. I’d worry they’d see me as needy.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Thank you for naming those thoughts and physical sensations. What would it be like to notice those reactions, thank your mind for trying to protect you, and then take the action anyway—just as an experiment? [defusion] [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It would be hard, but maybe freeing. I like the idea of thanking my mind, instead of fighting with it. I guess I could try texting a friend and see what happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a courageous step. If you were to send that text, what value would you be honoring in yourself? [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Probably connection, and maybe also courage. I want to have real relationships, even if it means being vulnerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s beautiful, Sarah. Even the smallest act in the service of connection and courage can be meaningful. As you imagine taking that step, what emotions or thoughts are coming up right now? [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I feel a mix of hope and anxiety. Part of me is excited at the idea of not being so alone, but there’s still that voice telling me it won’t work out. It’s a tug-of-war inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That tug-of-war is so familiar for many people—the pull between hope and fear. What would it be like to simply notice both sides, without needing to choose one or the other right now? [acceptance] [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I think I can do that. If I notice both, maybe I won’t be so overwhelmed by just the fear. It helps to see that there’s also hope in there.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly—both feelings can exist side by side. Sometimes, making space for all our feelings, even the uncomfortable ones, can free up energy for what matters. If you imagine your future self, a year from now, living more in line with connection and courage, what do you hope would be different? [values] [self-as-context]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I hope I’d be less afraid to reach out to people. Maybe I’d have closer friendships, or feel more confident at work. Mostly, I’d like to feel like I belong, even if I’m not perfect.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That vision is really powerful. Notice how your mind might want to jump in and say “That’s not possible” or “You’ll never get there”—and see if you can just thank it for trying to protect you, then gently bring your focus back to your hopes. What’s it like to hold space for both skepticism and hope? [defusion] [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It’s comforting, actually. I can see that my mind is just trying to keep me safe, but I don’t have to let it run the show. There’s something reassuring about not having to get rid of the doubts to move forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a really important shift. Our minds are great at warning us about potential dangers, but sometimes the cost is missing out on what matters. When you notice your inner critic, what might you say to yourself to acknowledge its presence, but not let it dictate your choices? [defusion] [self-as-context]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe something like, “There you are again, trying to keep me safe. Thanks, but I’m going to try this anyway.” That feels more compassionate than just yelling at myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a wonderful way to relate to your inner critic—with kindness rather than hostility. It might take practice, but each time you notice and acknowledge it, you’re building a new relationship with those thoughts. As we wrap up today, what’s one small step you feel ready to try this week, in the direction of your values? [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I think I’ll try texting a friend to make plans, even if I feel anxious about it. And maybe I’ll write down what my mind says when I start to doubt myself, just to get some distance from those thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That sounds like a thoughtful and manageable plan. Remember, it’s not about doing it perfectly, but about taking steps toward what matters, even with doubts along for the ride. How are you feeling about what we’ve talked about today? [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I feel a little lighter, honestly. It’s good to know I don’t have to wait until I feel “better” to try to change things. I’m nervous, but also hopeful.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: I’m really glad to hear that. You’ve shown a lot of courage today in exploring these difficult feelings and considering new ways to respond to them. I look forward to hearing about how your experiment with reaching out goes, and we can keep building on this together. [values] [committed-action]\n",

      "T: Welcome back Sarah, it's good to see you. How have things been since our last meeting? I recall you mentioned wanting to explore feelings of failure today - where would you like to begin with that? [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Honestly? I feel stuck in this loop where every setback confirms I'm failing at life. Last week I froze during a presentation at work, and since then I've been avoiding emails and meetings. The thought \"You're inadequate\" just plays on repeat in my head constantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It sounds like that critical thought has really taken hold. I'm curious - when \"I'm inadequate\" shows up, do you notice physical sensations too? Like maybe tightness in your chest or shoulders? [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: *sighs* Yes, like a heavy weight here *touches chest*. And then I scramble to distract myself - binging shows, overworking, anything to escape. But avoiding it just makes me feel guiltier about failing at handling my own emotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Thank you for naming that avoidance pattern so honestly. What if we gently approached this differently? Instead of wrestling with the thought, could we just notice it passing through, like a cloud drifting across the sky? [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I try, but it feels impossible when the feeling is so intense. That voice says \"If you were competent, you wouldn't be struggling like this.\" It ties into childhood stuff - my dad constantly said \"Winners don't make excuses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Ah, so this \"failure\" story has deep roots. Notice how it blends past memory with present judgment. Could we try something experiential? Close your eyes and breathe into that chest tightness for a moment... just observing without fixing it. [self-as-context]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: *after pause* It's still there... but less overwhelming when I don't fight it? Like background noise instead of a shout. That's surprising actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful noticing! You're discovering the space between sensation and reaction. Now, when \"failure\" shows up today, what's underneath it? Maybe a care for something important? [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: *voice cracks* It hurts because... I deeply value being capable and contributing meaningfully. But avoiding work makes me betray that value - which just confirms the failure story!\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That insight is gold. Your pain points directly to your values - competence and contribution matter greatly. How might this change if we saw avoidance not as failure, but as your mind trying to protect you from hurt? [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That... makes it less shameful. But how do I stop the cycle? Yesterday I skipped my team call again because I couldn't face them after the presentation disaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Let's gently disentangle here. The \"disaster\" story is a thought, yes? What if we name it each time it appears: \"Ah, the 'I humiliated myself' story is back.\" Just labeling creates distance. [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Okay... \"The failure story is here.\" Huh. It does feel less solid when I say it that way. Like it doesn't define me entirely?\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly! You're the sky, not the storm passing through. Now, connecting to your value of contribution - what tiny step could honor that today? Even something microscopic? [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I could... reply to one easy email? Not all fifty, just one. But what if I mess it up? That old panic surges just thinking about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Notice where you feel that \"what if\" in your body right now. Breathe space around it while holding your intention: \"I'm choosing to act for my values, alongside discomfort.\" [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: *takes audible breath* It's buzzing in my stomach... but persisting feels different than avoiding. Like I'm choosing me over the fear?\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Profound shift! You're contacting the difference between being hijacked by thoughts and consciously choosing action. How might celebrating that small win nourish you? Even mentally whispering \"I showed up\"? [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That actually brings tears... because I've been so cruel to myself. Instead of \"Why can't you do more?\" I could whisper \"You did the brave thing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful self-compassion. Now, let's anchor this: When old failure stories appear this week, how will you greet them? Maybe \"Hello story, I see you - but I'm mailing that one email anyway\"? [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Yes. And when avoidance tempts me, I'll touch my chest and remember: This heaviness means I care deeply. That's not failure - it's human.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly. Your pain isn't a flaw; it's a testament to your values. Shall we explore how to gently widen these courageous steps next week? [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Please. For the first time in months... this doesn't feel hopeless. Thank you for seeing me through this storm.\n",
      "\n",

      "T: Hi Sarah, welcome back. I’ve been thinking about what you emailed—how the sense of failure keeps showing up and how hard it is to stay with those thoughts. I’d love to start right there today if that feels okay. What’s the flavor of that failure feeling when it’s most vivid?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It’s like a tight band around my chest and this whisper that keeps saying, “You blew it, you’ll never catch up.” I try to push it away—scroll, snack, anything—but the band just gets tighter. Sometimes I rehearse the mistakes in my head like a courtroom drama where I’m always guilty.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: So the mind is both prosecutor and judge, and the body becomes the courtroom. [defusion] What happens if we slow it down and just notice the prosecutor voice as a voice—maybe even give it a name or a silly accent—so we can see it’s not the same as you? We’re not trying to silence it, just to loosen its grip a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: If I call it “Judge Judy on Red Bull,” it does feel slightly less powerful, but the fear underneath still screams. I’m terrified that if I stop fighting the thought, it’ll turn out to be true and I’ll collapse. My whole life feels like it’s balanced on proving that thought wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s the bargain the mind offers: “Keep struggling or the worst will happen.” [acceptance] What if, just for the next minute, we let Judge Judy rant while we breathe into that chest band and notice where the sensation begins and ends—no fixing, just mapping? I’ll breathe with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Okay… I feel the band most under my sternum, radiating out to my shoulders. There’s heat and a kind of buzzing. Judge Judy is yelling, “You’re wasting time even noticing this!” I notice an urge to grab my phone, but I leave it in my lap.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Great noticing—urge to escape shows up, and you’re still here. [present-moment] Let’s thank Judge Judy for trying to protect you from disappointment, then gently place her on an imaginary stool in the corner. She can keep talking; we’ll keep breathing. How’s the band now?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It’s still there, but it’s like the volume on the buzzing dropped from a nine to a six. I’m surprised I didn’t implode. But I’m also suspicious—what if this is just a trick and the failure feeling will come back stronger later?\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That suspicion is another protective move—“If I brace hard enough, maybe I won’t be blindsided.” [self-as-context] Can you sense the part of you that notices both the band and the suspicion? That observing space is bigger than any single feeling; it can hold them all without being defined by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I can kind of touch it—like I’m sitting in a wide field and the thoughts are weather moving through. But I don’t trust the field yet. I keep thinking, “If I really am a failure, then the field is just denial.”\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful honesty. Let’s test that by turning toward a specific memory where the failure story feels most convincing. Which episode does Judge Judy wave as Exhibit A?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Last year I froze during a presentation to the board. My voice cracked, the slides jammed, and I ended up excusing myself halfway through. My boss had to finish. Ever since, I’ve avoided any speaking opportunities, and I feel smaller each time I say no.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Thank you for bringing that in. [values] Before we dive into the pain, can I ask: what value was underneath that presentation—what mattered to you that made standing up there important in the first place?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I wanted to contribute, to show my team that their work was worth visibility. And honestly, I wanted to grow into leadership so I could mentor younger women like my first boss mentored me. But the freeze felt like proof I’m not leadership material.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: So the same heart that values contribution and mentorship now gets labeled “not leadership material.” [defusion] What if we treat that label as another mental product—sticky, loud, but still just words? Can we replay the scene slowly, noticing sensations and thoughts as weather in the field?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’m already bracing, but okay. I see the boardroom table, the hum of the projector. My chest band is back at an eight. Judge Judy shouts, “See, you choked!” My hands feel clammy.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Let’s anchor in the feet on the floor, the back against the chair. [present-moment] Notice five points of contact, then allow the clamminess and the voice to be there. Can you silently thank your body for sounding the alarm even if the alarm is outdated?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I whisper, “Thanks, body, I get you’re trying to keep me safe from judgment.” The clamminess doesn’t vanish, but it stops spreading. I can feel my toes again.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Good. Now, from that wider field, look at the younger you at that table. [self-as-context] If that part of you could speak, what might she need to hear—not to erase the freeze, but to hold it kindly?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: She’d need someone to say, “Freezing doesn’t erase your care or your competence. It just means fear hijacked your throat for three minutes.” I tear up saying that. I never gave her compassion—only criticism.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Let’s take a moment to let that tear move. [acceptance] There’s grief here for all the opportunities turned down in the name of not repeating that three-minute hijack. Can we honor that grief without making it a verdict on your future?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It feels huge, like I’m mourning the confident speaker I might have been. But also a tiny relief, like maybe the story isn’t finished. I’m scared to hope, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Hope can be scary because it feels like another place to fall from. [values] What if we shift from hoping to be confident and instead commit to practicing courage in the service of contribution and mentorship—even if fear comes along for the ride?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That reframes it. Courage I can touch; confidence feels like a finish line I never reach. I still don’t know how to start practicing without drowning in panic.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Let’s design a small experiment. [committed-action] What’s the tiniest step that would serve your values yet still trigger just enough fear to be meaningful—not overwhelming, just informative?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe volunteering to present the team update at our next staff meeting—five minutes, friendly crowd, slides I already know. My heart races just saying it.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Notice the race—data, not danger. [defusion] If we rate the fear zero to ten, what number shows up right now?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: About a seven. But there’s also a flicker of excitement, maybe a three. The two feelings are layered, like a chord.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful—anxiety and excitement often share physiology. [present-moment] Can you place a hand on your racing heart and thank it for gearing up to support something that matters? Then let’s plan how to carry that chord into the meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I could rehearse once the night before, not ten times. I could tell my colleague Sam I’m nervous so I’m not alone with Judge Judy. And maybe have a grounding phrase like “contribute and connect” taped to my notebook.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: I love the specificity. [committed-action] What day is the meeting?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Next Thursday at ten. I just put it in my calendar in bold. My stomach flipped when I hit save.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Flipping is allowed. [acceptance] Imagine it’s Thursday 9:55 a.m.—what might you do in those five minutes to anchor in the field rather than the storm?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I could step into the restroom, feel my feet, do two slow breaths, and remind myself, “The goal is to contribute, not to impress.” Then walk in with the fear as a passenger, not the driver.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That sounds workable. How does the chest band respond to imagining that sequence now?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It’s still there, maybe a five, but it feels like background music instead of a straitjacket. I’m surprised planning with acceptance feels different from my usual over-preparation spiral.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Over-preparation is often avoidance in disguise—trying to eliminate fear rather than carry it. [avoidance] When you notice the spiral starting, what’s one gentle cue to pivot back to the plan?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I could silently say, “Spiral spotted,” and then ask, “What would contribution look like right now?” That question cuts through the perfectionism.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Excellent. Let’s also anticipate Judge Judy showing up Thursday with new material—maybe “Your voice will crack again.” How might you respond in the moment?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I could nod inwardly and say, “Thanks for the prediction, Judy. I’m driving today.” Then re-focus on the first friendly face in the room. I’ve never tried talking back without arguing.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s defusion in action—acknowledging the mind without obeying it. [defusion] Any other passengers likely to hitch a ride Thursday?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: The “Everyone thinks you’re incompetent” chorus might join. Same strategy: greet them, use my phrase, ground in my feet. I feel a little ridiculous scripting this, but also steadier.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Nothing ridiculous about rehearsing values-based moves. Athletes visualize; why not us? [values] After the meeting, how will you measure success?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Not by whether I’m flawless, but by whether I spoke up despite fear and stayed connected to the team. Even if I stumble, if I finish and learn, that’s a win.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a radical shift from the old metric of “no anxiety, no mistakes.” [committed-action] What support might you need between now and Thursday?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe text Sam tonight so the commitment feels real. And I’ll practice the breathing once a day, not obsessively. Could I email you Thursday afternoon with how it went?\n",
      "\n",
      "T: I’d love that. We can celebrate whatever shows up—success or new learning. [acceptance] Before we close, take a breath and scan from head to toe. What’s the strongest sensation right now?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: A warmth in my belly that wasn’t there at the start—like a small pilot light of determination. The chest band is looser, maybe a three. I’m still nervous, but it feels workable.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That pilot light is yours to tend. [self-as-context] Any final words to the observing field that’s holding all of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Thank you for not abandoning me when the thoughts got loud. I’m scared, but I’m still here, and Thursday hasn’t even happened yet. That feels like enough for today.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful. I’m here too, cheering on the courage to contribute and connect. See you on the other side of Thursday, and we’ll keep building from whatever unfolds.\n",
