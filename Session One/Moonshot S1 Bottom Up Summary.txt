Therapy Session Summary:

Client’s emotional state  
- Guarded and skeptical, yet curious. The client is willing to “go on faith,” but anxiety and a need for clarity are evident (“it makes me a bit worried, which I don’t really like”).

Main issues discussed  
1. Uncertainty about the therapy model and the therapist’s inability to give a detailed description.  
2. The client’s fear that lack of a clear rationale signals incompetence (“if you can’t tell other people what it is that you do … then you don’t really understand it yourself”).  
3. The client’s habitual fusion with thoughts and avoidance of uncertainty (“I don’t really like [fusion, avoidance]”).

Therapeutic themes / metaphors  
- Reporter vs. coach: describing accurately vs. talking to make a difference.  
- Skiing metaphor: over-thinking instructions can make the skier awkward; the goal is to move, not to analyze the movement.  
- “Get out of the war instead of winning it” – a central ACT metaphor suggesting the shift from struggle with internal experiences to willingness and values-based action.

Possible directions for therapy  
- Begin experiential exercises that demonstrate the model rather than explain it (e.g., brief mindfulness or defusion techniques).  
- Address the client’s rule-governed behavior (“I need a map before I can move”) by highlighting the cost of waiting for certainty.  
- Use values clarification to identify what the client wants life to be about beyond the struggle, giving the “coach” words a concrete target.
