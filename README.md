This repository contains code and data for a project exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to support therapy and coaching practices. The work was carried out in collaboration with the Rize Team at Queen’s University Belfast.

#Repository Structure

1. The repository is organized by session, with Session 1–4 each containing:

2. Text Generation: Synthetic therapy session transcripts generated using multiple LLMs.

3. Summarisation: Both Bottom-Up and Top-Down (RAG) summarisation methods were applied to session transcripts.

4. Messages: Between-session notifications generated from summarised data to reinforce therapeutic themes.

5. Quantitative Analysis: Readability and linguistic complexity metrics (e.g., Flesch Reading Ease, Dale–Chall Readability, Sentence Length, Lexicon Count, Sentence Count) for each output.

6. The average metrics across all sessions were calculated manually to compare LLM performance.

Contents

Session 1–4 Folders: Contain all Python scripts and analysis notebooks for each session.

Data: Input transcripts and notification templates used for generation tasks.

Results: Quantitative analysis outputs for text, summaries, and notifications.
