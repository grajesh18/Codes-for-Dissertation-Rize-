Therapy Session Summary:

Emotional state  
The client feels “fair to shitty,” describing emotions as “all over the place.”  Physical pain (migraine-like headaches, joint/nerve aches, foot injury) is amplifying irritability and a sense of helplessness.  There is underlying anger (“pissed at the circumstances”) and self-criticism (“I feel like a basket case”).

Main issues discussed  
1. Somatic distress: new medication side-effects, chronic pain, and inability to hike/walk—activities that usually regulate mood.  
2. Cognitive rigidity: strong all-or-nothing (“black-or-white”) thinking that the client intellectually recognizes but cannot yet soften.  
3. Work-driven identity: fear that without constant pushing he would “not know what to do with myself,” yet this drive is exhausting and painful.  
4. Therapy alliance: client questions the value of continuing (“what the hell am I doing…?”) while simultaneously seeking reassurance about the plan.

Therapeutic themes / metaphors  
• “Slippery mind”: therapist reframes the client’s quick, self-critical intellect as a protective mechanism that now needs to be worked “around” rather than defeated.  
• Pinball machine: client’s image of thoughts lighting up chaotically, illustrating how stimuli bounce rapidly between extremes.  
• Roses vs. grind: tension between “smell the roses” (acceptance, rest) and the ingrained mandate to “keep working, keep pushing.”

Possible directions for therapy  
1. Psycho-education and coordination with prescribing physician to track medication effects and pain symptoms.  
2. Introduce mindfulness or ACT techniques to create distance from the “slippery mind” and experiment with gray-area thinking.  
3. Values clarification: explore what “results” and “learning” truly mean to him beyond productivity, linking them to hiking, parenting, and other intrinsically rewarding activities.  
4. Behavioral experiments: graded re-engagement in walking/hiking while practicing self-compassion for physical limits.  
5. Re-contracting: at session 10, collaboratively review goals and decide whether to continue, ensuring the client feels active in the process.
