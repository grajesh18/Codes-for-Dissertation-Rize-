      "**ACT-Informed Session Summary**\n",
      "\n",
      "Across these session segments, several core Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) processes were actively explored and practiced. The therapist and client worked collaboratively to foster greater psychological flexibility through experiential exercises, metaphors, and mindful inquiry.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Acceptance of Internal Experience:**  \n",
      "The therapist consistently encouraged the client to notice and name their thoughts, feelings, and evaluations, inviting an attitude of openness rather than struggle or avoidance. Whether through mindfulness exercises or expressive writing, the client was supported in allowing difficult or unwanted experiences to arise and pass without suppression. This included normalizing the persistent, sometimes unruly nature of the mind, and highlighting that the goal is not to eliminate thoughts or feelings, but to relate to them differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Cognitive Defusion:**  \n",
      "A variety of metaphors and exercises—such as “leaves on a stream,” colored bubbles, and expressive writing—were used to help the client observe thoughts and evaluations as transient mental events, rather than literal truths or commands. The therapist guided the client to notice the process of thinking and evaluating, and to distinguish between observing thoughts and getting entangled in them. This defusion work was evident both in session and through homework assignments, with the client describing moments of being “jerked back and forth” between observing and being caught up in thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Contact with the Present Moment (Mindfulness):**  \n",
      "Mindfulness was woven throughout the sessions, with the therapist inviting the client to notice what is happening right now, both during structured exercises and in spontaneous discussion. The client observed how labeling or evaluating experiences could pull them out of the present, and practiced returning attention to current sensations, emotions, and thoughts with openness and curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Self-as-Context (The Observing Self):**  \n",
      "The therapist supported the client in contacting a stable, observing sense of self—the “you” that is always present and able to notice internal experiences without being defined by them. This was explored through direct inquiry (“There’s a ‘you’ there that’s been there all this time…”) and through exercises that distinguished between “looking at” versus “looking from” thoughts and feelings. The client reported moments of observing thoughts go by, reflecting brief but meaningful contact with this perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Values and Committed Action (Emerging):**  \n",
      "While not always the explicit focus, the sessions laid important groundwork for values clarification and committed action. The therapist gently redirected the client from outcome-based living (“feel good”) to process-based living (“do a good job of feeling”), and highlighted how willingness to experience discomfort can serve valued ends. The client’s engagement in challenging exercises, such as intentionally recalling and writing about difficult memories, demonstrated a willingness to move toward what matters, even in the presence of discomfort.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Functional Contextualism and Workability:**  \n",
      "The therapist repeatedly emphasized the pragmatic ACT focus on what is workable—what helps the client move toward a more meaningful, values-based life, rather than what is “right” or “wrong.” The limits of the problem-solving mind, especially when applied to internal experiences, were discussed, and the client was encouraged to experiment with new, more flexible ways of responding to thoughts and feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Summary:**  \n",
      "Throughout these sessions, the therapist utilized metaphors, mindfulness, and experiential exercises to help the client distinguish between being fused with thoughts and observing them with openness. The client demonstrated increasing insight into the difference between struggling with internal experiences and accepting them, and was encouraged to practice mindful observation both in and out of session. The therapeutic work focused on increasing psychological flexibility by fostering acceptance, defusion, present-moment awareness, and a sense of self-as-context, while gently preparing the ground for deeper exploration of values and committed action. This integrative approach supported the client in moving toward a richer, more meaningful life, even in the presence of difficult thoughts and feelings.\n"
