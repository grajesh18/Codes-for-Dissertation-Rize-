[defusion]
You are not your thoughts. You can observe them without getting caught in them.

When you act in alignment with your values, you build a life that feels meaningful—even in the presence of discomfort.

[committed-action]
Small steps matter. Even tiny actions toward your values can reinforce change and build momentum.

[present-moment]
When you're caught up in thoughts about the past or future, gently return to what’s happening right now.

There’s a part of you that observes experiences without judgment—that self is always available, no matter what thoughts arise.

Progress is not perfection. Keep choosing what matters, even when it's hard.

[reflection]
This week, take a few minutes to notice: what actions felt most aligned with your values?

[grounding]
