      "T: Hi Sarah, I’m glad you could make it today. I’d like to start by checking in—how have things been for you since we last spoke?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Thanks. Honestly, it’s been rough. I keep finding myself overwhelmed by my emotions, especially anger and anxiety, and I’m not really sure what to do with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That sounds really tough, Sarah. When those emotions show up, how do you usually respond? Do you notice any patterns in what you do or how you try to manage them? [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I usually try to push them away or distract myself. I’ll scroll through my phone, eat junk food, or just avoid talking to anyone. Sometimes I’ll snap at people without meaning to, and then I feel guilty afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It sounds like there’s a lot going on internally—strong feelings, efforts to avoid them, and then some guilt about how you react. When you notice yourself avoiding or snapping, what thoughts or beliefs tend to come up for you? [defusion] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: I often think I’m failing or that I should have more control. There’s this voice that says, “Why can’t you just handle this? Other people do.” And then I just want to hide.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That self-critical voice sounds really loud and demanding. When it tells you you’re failing or should have more control, how do you feel in your body? [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: My chest gets tight, and I feel kind of heavy, like I just want to curl up and disappear. Sometimes my hands shake or I feel this knot in my stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Thank you for sharing that. Let’s try something together for a moment. Can you notice that tightness in your chest and see if you can just sit with it, without trying to change or judge it? What happens if you allow the feeling to be there, just for a few breaths? [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’ll try… Okay. It’s uncomfortable, but I can feel it… It’s still there, but I guess it’s not getting worse. I usually want to run from it, but just noticing it is different.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s really brave, Sarah, and you’re doing something new by being present with the discomfort instead of immediately escaping it. What’s it like to notice you can stay with this feeling, even if only for a short time? [acceptance] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: It’s kind of weird… I always thought it would swallow me up, but I guess I’m still here. I don’t like it, but maybe I can handle more than I thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a powerful realization. It makes sense to want to avoid pain, but sometimes those avoidance strategies create more difficulties in the long run. What do you notice about yourself when you reflect on the ways you avoid or fight your feelings? [avoidance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I think I end up feeling worse. Like, I eat junk food to feel better, but then I feel gross and guilty. Or I push people away and then I’m lonely. It’s like I’m stuck in a loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That loop sounds exhausting. If you imagine stepping back from your thoughts for a moment—almost like watching them from a distance—how do those stories about control and failure look from that perspective? [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: From a distance, the thoughts seem kind of harsh. Like, I wouldn’t say that to a friend. They’re just stories I tell myself, but they feel real in the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a really helpful observation. Our minds are good at creating convincing stories, especially under stress, but sometimes those stories aren’t the whole truth. If you could speak to that critical voice, what would you want to say? [defusion] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: I guess I’d say, “You’re not helping.” Or maybe, “I’m doing my best. I don’t need you to make me feel worse.”\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautifully said. Sometimes, naming and talking back to that inner critic can help us see it as just one part of our experience, not the whole picture. What would it be like to notice those critical thoughts, and instead of believing them completely, just acknowledge them as thoughts your mind is offering? [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That sounds freeing, actually. I can see how it might make things feel less heavy. I’d like to try that—just noticing the thoughts, instead of fighting with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a great intention. Let’s practice for a moment. Can you bring to mind a recent situation where you felt emotionally overwhelmed, and notice the thoughts that came up? See if you can say to yourself, “I’m noticing I’m having the thought that…” and fill in the thought. [defusion]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Okay… Yesterday, I was angry at my partner for not helping with chores. I thought, “He doesn’t care about me.” So, “I’m noticing I’m having the thought that he doesn’t care about me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Excellent. How does it feel to phrase it that way, as “I’m noticing I’m having the thought that…” instead of just believing it’s absolutely true? [defusion] \n",
      "\n",
      "C: It feels a little less… permanent. Like, it’s just a thought passing through, not a fact set in stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s exactly the shift we’re aiming for. Creating that bit of space can open up new possibilities for how you respond. When you’re able to step back from those thoughts, what do you want your behavior to look like, especially in moments of conflict or intense emotion? [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I want to be calmer, to talk instead of yelling or shutting down. I’d like to be honest about how I feel without attacking or running away.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those are powerful values—calmness, honesty, and connection. When you imagine acting in line with those values, even when it’s difficult, what feelings or fears come up for you? [values] [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I get scared that I’ll be rejected or that people won’t take me seriously. Sometimes I worry that if I’m not angry, no one will listen to me. It’s hard to trust that being vulnerable is safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That fear of being hurt or ignored makes a lot of sense. If we could imagine making room for those fears, instead of letting them dictate your actions, what might that open up for you? [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe I’d feel less controlled by them. I could try things differently, even if it’s scary. I might actually get what I want—a real connection or understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s such a hopeful possibility. It’s natural to want to protect yourself, and sometimes our minds use anger or avoidance as shields. What would it be like to thank your mind for trying to keep you safe, and then choose actions that move you toward your values, even if discomfort is present? [self-as-context] [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’ve never thought of it that way. Maybe if I could appreciate that part of me, I wouldn’t have to fight it so much. I could let it be there, but still choose to act differently.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a compassionate approach, Sarah. Let’s explore a specific situation—maybe with your partner or another close relationship—where you’d like to respond differently next time. What might that look like if you were guided by your values and willing to accept some discomfort? [committed-action] [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I think I’d pause before reacting. Maybe say, “I’m feeling overwhelmed right now,” instead of yelling. I could ask for a few minutes to calm down before talking things through.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That sounds like a thoughtful plan. What do you imagine might get in the way of doing that in the moment? [barriers] [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: My emotions feel so strong, and it’s almost automatic to react. Sometimes I just want that relief right away, even if I regret it later. I worry I’ll forget to pause when I’m upset.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those automatic responses are deeply ingrained, and it’s completely normal for them to show up. Sometimes it helps to have a simple reminder—a word, phrase, or even a physical gesture—that can cue you to pause and notice what’s happening. What might be a helpful reminder for you? [present-moment] [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe I could try putting my hand on my heart when I feel angry. Or I could say to myself, “Pause.” That might help me remember to slow down.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a wonderful idea. Placing your hand on your heart can be a grounding gesture, and a simple “Pause” can be a powerful reminder. If you practice this, even outside of conflict, it can become more natural over time. How do you feel about giving this a try over the next week? [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’m willing to try. I know it won’t be perfect, but I like the idea of practicing. I want to have better control over my reactions, or at least not be so ruled by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That willingness is so important. Remember, the goal isn’t to get rid of difficult feelings or thoughts, but to relate to them differently so you have more freedom to choose your actions. What’s one small, specific situation where you can practice this pause, even if just for a moment? [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe when my partner leaves his socks on the floor. That’s something that usually annoys me right away. I could notice the irritation, put my hand on my heart, and pause before saying anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a great example. The more you practice in those smaller moments, the more prepared you’ll be for bigger challenges. When you imagine yourself pausing and choosing how to respond, what do you hope your partner might notice or experience? [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I hope he sees that I’m trying, and maybe it helps us talk instead of argue. I want him to know I care, even when I’m frustrated. I hope it brings us closer.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those are beautiful intentions, rooted in caring and connection. If things don’t go perfectly—which is completely normal—how can you offer yourself kindness instead of criticism? [acceptance] [self-as-context]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I could remind myself that I’m learning. Maybe tell myself, “It’s okay to make mistakes.” I don’t have to be perfect to make progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a compassionate approach, and it aligns with how you’d treat a friend in the same situation. Sometimes, self-kindness is just as important as any skill we practice. As you think about these changes, what fears or concerns do you notice coming up? [acceptance]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I worry it won’t make a difference, or that I’ll just fall back into old habits. I’m afraid I’ll disappoint myself or others. Sometimes I wonder if it’s even possible to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those doubts are natural, especially when you’re working on longstanding patterns. If you could hold those fears gently, rather than letting them stop you, what’s one thing you’d want to try anyway? [acceptance] [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’d want to keep practicing the pause, even if I mess up sometimes. I think just trying is worth something. Maybe I’ll surprise myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Absolutely, the act of trying is already a step toward change. And over time, those small efforts add up. If we look at the bigger picture, what kind of person do you want to become through this process? [values]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I want to be more patient and understanding—with myself and others. I want to feel like I can handle my emotions instead of being afraid of them. I’d like to be someone who can face hard things without running away.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Those are such meaningful values—patience, understanding, courage. When you find yourself stuck in avoidance or self-criticism, how can you use those values as a compass to guide your behavior? [values] [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Maybe I can ask, “What would a patient or brave version of me do right now?” That could help me make choices that fit who I want to be, not just how I feel in the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a great strategy, Sarah. Sometimes, imagining ourselves as the person we want to become can help us bridge the gap between intention and action. How do you feel having talked through all of this today? [present-moment]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I actually feel a little lighter. It’s good to have a plan, and to know I’m not alone in feeling this way. I’m nervous, but also hopeful.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: I’m really glad to hear that. Remember, change is a process, and every step counts—even the small ones. What’s one thing you want to take with you from today’s session? [values] [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I want to remember that my thoughts aren’t facts, and I can pause before reacting. I want to practice being kinder to myself when things are hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s a wonderful takeaway. I appreciate your openness and willingness to explore these difficult topics today. Would you like to check in about how things go with the pause and self-kindness next time? [committed-action]\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Yes, I think that would help. It would keep me accountable and give me something to focus on.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Great, we’ll plan to revisit that. Before we wrap up, is there anything else on your mind, or anything you’d like to ask or share?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: No, I think we covered a lot. Thank you for listening and helping me figure this out.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: It’s truly my pleasure, Sarah. You’re doing important work, and I look forward to hearing how things go. Take care until next time.\n",

      "T: Sarah, I'm really glad you're here today. From what you've shared before, it sounds like these waves of intense emotion—anger, sadness—often feel overwhelming, like they're hijacking your whole experience. Can you tell me what that storm feels like in your body right now? [present-moment]  \n",
      "\n",
      "C: It’s... like my chest is too tight to breathe, and my thoughts just spiral—\"I can’t handle this,\" \"Why am I so weak?\" I immediately want to numb it all by binge-watching shows or isolating myself. The worst part is knowing I’m avoiding, which just makes me hate myself more.  \n",
      "\n",
      "T: That self-judgment sounds painful, and I notice how quickly your mind jumps to solutions like numbing [avoidance]. When \"I can’t handle this\" shows up, does it feel like a command you must obey, or just a thought passing through? [defusion]  \n",
      "\n",
      "C: It feels absolutely real—like a truth. If I don’t distract myself, I’ll shatter. But then I’m stuck in this loop: feel awful, avoid, feel guilty. I’m so tired of fighting myself.  \n",
      "\n",
      "T: What if that \"shattering\" isn’t a fact, but a story your mind creates to protect you? Like an overzealous bodyguard tackling imaginary threats. [defusion] Could we gently explore what happens when you pause before reacting?  \n",
      "\n",
      "C: Pausing terrifies me—it’s like standing in front of a tsunami. Last week, I felt rage after a work meeting, and instead of scrolling on my phone, I just... sat there. The anger burned so fiercely I cried. It felt like failure.  \n",
      "\n",
      "T: Actually, Sarah, that sounds like courage. You stayed present with the fire instead of fleeing [acceptance]. Those tears—were they just sensations, or did they mean something deeper about you? [self-as-context]  \n",
      "\n",
      "C: They made me feel broken. Like I’m defective because I can’t \"control\" my emotions like others seem to. My mind screams, \"Fix this now!\"  \n",
      "\n",
      "T: Ah, the \"fix-it\" reflex—our culture’s favorite trap! [defusion] What if control isn’t the goal? Imagine your emotions as weather patterns: you wouldn’t blame the sky for rain. Could we try a metaphor to untangle this?  \n",
      "\n",
      "C: Okay... though metaphors sometimes feel like you’re dodging the real problem.  \n",
      "\n",
      "T: Fair! Let’s make it concrete. Picture a chessboard [self-as-context]. The black pieces are painful thoughts—\"I’m defective.\" The white are positive ones—\"I’m strong.\" You’re the board, holding all of them without joining either side. Where do you feel that \"broken\" piece sitting right now?  \n",

      "T: So the swarm arrives with the message “If you pause, you’ll get stung.” [defusion] Let’s hold that thought lightly for a moment and notice the actual sensations—tight chest, buzzing mind—without leaping into action. Can you feel the tightness and still keep your seat?\n",
      "\n",

      "T: Ah, the mind predicts catastrophe if we stop controlling. [avoidance] It’s offering you a bargain: keep running or be annihilated. Have you noticed whether running actually dissolves the black hole, or just keeps you sprinting around it?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Sprinting, definitely. The hole never closes; it just follows me. I’ll binge a show, scroll my phone, reorganize the pantry—anything so I don’t have to look at it. But it’s still there, heavier at 2 a.m. when the distractions run out.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: So the control strategies give temporary relief but charge interest later. [acceptance] I’m wondering what tiny piece of that 2 a.m. heaviness you’d be willing to carry into the light right now, here with me, without fixing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It’s a mix of shame and grief. Shame that I can’t handle normal adult life, grief that I’m always braced for the next wave. They feel like twin weights chained to my ankles.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Shame says “I’m broken,” grief says “I’ve lost something precious.” [defusion] If those were just sounds your mind makes—like background radio—could you let the sounds play while you stay curious about the actual sensations of weight around your ankles?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: When I try, my mind argues, “Curiosity won’t pay the bills or silence the panic.” It’s like a courtroom drama in there, and curiosity feels like a flaky public defender.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Nice image—courtroom drama. [self-as-context] Imagine you’re not the defendant, the prosecutor, or even the flaky defender. Picture yourself as the courtroom itself: walls, ceiling, floor. All those voices echo inside you, but you’re the space that holds them. How does that shift things?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I feel a weird spaciousness, like I just stepped back twenty feet. The voices are still loud, but they’re tiny figures now. I’m not sure I trust it, though—what if the walls crumble?\n",
      "\n",
      "T: The mind will always forecast collapse; that’s its job. [acceptance] But notice you’re still here, still breathing. Let’s test the crumbling fear: can you breathe into the walls and notice any cracks widening, or is the spaciousness still holding?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: The cracks aren’t widening; they’re flickering like bad Wi-Fi. My breath is shaky but it’s moving. I can sense the floor of the courtroom under me—solid enough for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Good. From that floor, I’d like to invite you to place the twin weights—shame and grief—on the chessboard we talked about last time. [self-as-context] See the board with all its pieces: panic, shame, grocery lists, birthday gifts. Where would you like to set those two pieces so you can see them without being them?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’ll put shame on a black pawn square and grief on a white bishop square. They’re still on the board, but I’m… above it? Like I’m the wood grain of the board itself, not the pieces fighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly. The wood doesn’t have to eliminate the pieces to be whole. [values] From that vantage point, what matters enough that you’d keep those pieces on the board rather than flipping the whole game over?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: My daughter. She’s eight. I don’t want her to inherit this frantic sprinting. I want her to see that emotions don’t have to be enemies. That’s probably the only reason I’m here instead of folding laundry right now.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful. So “being a model for my daughter” is a value that can coexist with shame and grief riding along. [committed-action] What’s one small move you could make this week that serves that value, even if the swarm and the black hole come too?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I could sit with her while she does homework without multitasking—no phone, no mental to-do list. Just be present. But I’m scared I’ll snap or space out.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: The fear of snapping is another piece on the board—maybe a knight that jumps around unpredictably. [defusion] If you bring the courtroom or the chessboard with you to the homework table, could you let the knight jump while still choosing to keep eye contact with your daughter?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I think so. If I remind myself I’m the wood grain, not the knight, maybe I can watch the jump without riding it. But what if she notices I’m tense?\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Then you get to model something even richer: “Mom feels tense and stays anyway.” That’s emotional regulation in real time. [acceptance] Could you name it out loud? “I’m feeling a storm in my body, and I’m choosing to sit with you.”\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That feels exposing, but also… honest. She’s asked before why I sigh so much. Maybe I can tell her the sigh is just weather.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Weather-reporting instead of storm-dodging. [present-moment] Let’s practice a five-second weather report right now. Look at me and describe the current climate inside you without fixing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: There’s a cold front in my chest, pressure dropping behind my eyes, and scattered showers of “you’re not enough.” That’s the forecast.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Thank you. I felt the authenticity land between us. [values] Now, from that same honest place, what’s the tiniest committed action you’ll take with your daughter tonight?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’ll ask her to pick one worksheet, set a ten-minute timer, and I’ll keep my hand on her shoulder the whole time unless she doesn’t want it. If the storm gets loud, I’ll name it like we just practiced.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Lovely. And if shame leans over and whispers, “You’re only doing this to look like a good mom,” how will you respond from the wood grain?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’ll say, “Thanks, shame, noted,” and keep my hand on her shoulder anyway. The wood doesn’t argue; it just holds.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Perfect. [committed-action] Now let’s zoom out. You’ve named shame, grief, panic, and the fear of collapse. Which of these feels most in charge of your life right now?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Panic. It hijacks my mornings. The second my eyes open, adrenaline floods and I’m scrolling emails before my feet hit the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Classic panic alarm. [avoidance] What’s the function of that scroll? What does it promise you?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It promises I can outrun disaster—if I see every subject line, nothing can blindside me. But it’s like trying to drink from a fire hose; I just get soaked and still thirsty.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: So the scroll is a control valve that never shuts off. [acceptance] Let’s experiment tomorrow morning. Instead of reaching for the phone, you place both feet on the ground and feel the adrenaline like a surge of electricity. Can you let it sizzle for thirty seconds without moving?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Thirty seconds feels like an eternity when panic’s screaming. My brain will say I’m wasting precious disaster-prevention time.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly—let’s thank the brain for that forecast. [defusion] “Thank you, mind, for protecting me from imaginary catastrophes.” Then return attention to the soles of your feet. Do you notice any difference between the thought “I must check emails” and the actual vibration in your feet?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: The thought is loud and fast; the vibration is… steadier, almost like a bass drum under the cymbals.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful distinction. [present-moment] Stay with the bass drum. If you can ride that beat for thirty seconds, you’re practicing willingness instead of avoidance. How might that willingness serve the value you have with your daughter?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It means I start the day calmer, so when she bursts in with her own morning storm, I’m not already maxed out. I can meet her energy instead of barking at her to find her shoes faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly. [committed-action] Let’s stack the commitments: tonight the homework shoulder-touch, tomorrow morning the thirty-second foot-feel. Any resistance popping up as we speak them aloud?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: A voice says, “Two new habits in one day? You’ll fail by noon.” That’s the prosecutor again.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Let’s have the courtroom wood grain absorb that gavel slam. [self-as-context] Failure is just another chess piece—maybe a rook sliding sideways. Can the board hold both success and failure without splintering?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: The board’s held worse. I once burnt dinner, cried, and still managed bedtime stories. The rook didn’t break it.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Good memory. [values] So if the rook of failure lands, you can still read bedtime stories. Speaking of stories, what does your mind predict will happen if you actually allow shame and grief to stay on the board long-term?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: It says they’ll multiply like rabbits until the whole board is black and white blur, no room for anything else. I’ll become this walking cloud of heaviness and drag everyone down.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: That’s the fusion talking—believing the forecast is the weather. [defusion] Let’s test it gently. Right now, with shame on the pawn square and grief on the bishop square, do you feel 100% consumed, or is there still color elsewhere on the board?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: There’s color. I can see the queen of love for my daughter, the knight of curiosity about this therapy stuff. The board’s crowded but not monochrome.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: So the mind’s prediction isn’t matching current data. [acceptance] What would it be like to let the rabbits hop without fencing them in or stomping them out?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Exhausting at first, maybe, but less lonely. I’m tired of pretending I’m fine when my eyes are puffy from crying in the car before school pickup.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Pretending is another control strategy. [values] What would authenticity look like at school pickup today?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Instead of fixing my face and chirping, “How was your day?” I could say, “I had a rough moment this afternoon, but I’m glad to see you.” Keep it simple, not a trauma dump, just real.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful. [committed-action] Let’s add that as a third layer: homework shoulder-touch, morning foot-feel, pickup authenticity. Any overwhelm rising?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: My chest is doing that tight thing again, but it’s more like stage fright before opening night. I know the lines; I just don’t trust the audience.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: The audience is your daughter, the school parking lot, and your own mind. [self-as-context] Can you be the theater instead of the performer? The walls hold applause and rotten tomatoes alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I like that. The theater doesn’t take the reviews personally; it just houses the play.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Exactly. [present-moment] Let’s close our eyes for three breaths and feel the theater. Notice the air on your skin, the sounds from the hallway, the tightness in your chest as part of the scenery, not the script.\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I can feel the seat under me, the hum of the AC, and the chest-tightness is like a prop piece—cardboard, not iron.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Good. [defusion] When you open your eyes, that prop comes with you, but it’s lighter. Ready to open?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Yes. The prop’s still there, but I can see the edges now; it’s not fused to my ribs.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Lovely. Let’s anchor back to the value of modeling emotional courage for your daughter. If she were watching this very moment, what would she learn?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: That big feelings don’t make you broken—they make you human, and humans can sit still with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Beautiful. [committed-action] So tonight, if the cardboard chest prop flares while you’re touching her shoulder, you can silently say, “This is the prop doing its job,” and stay. How does that plan sit?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: Scary but doable. Like holding a sparkler instead of a stick of dynamite.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Great metaphor. [acceptance] And if the sparkler burns your fingers a little, that’s feedback, not failure. Before we wrap, any last piece on the chessboard that wants to be seen?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: There’s a tiny pawn labeled “hope” that’s been hiding behind shame. It’s shaking but still upright.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Let’s move hope one square forward. [values] Even a pawn can become a queen if it keeps stepping. What’s one square of hope you can claim between now and our next session?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: I’ll text a mom-friend and ask if she wants to walk the track Saturday morning. I’ve been avoiding her because I’m scared I’ll cry in public, but hope says connection might help.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Perfect. [committed-action] If tears come on the track, you can let them be weather in the outdoor theater. Any final resistance to texting her?\n",
      "\n",
      "C: My thumb is already hovering. I’ll hit send as soon as I leave this room.\n",
      "\n",
      "T: Then I’ll bow to the theater and exit stage left. Thank you for letting me witness the whole cast of characters today.\n",
