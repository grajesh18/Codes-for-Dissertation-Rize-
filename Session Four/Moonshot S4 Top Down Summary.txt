ACT-Informed Summary:

ACT Principles Illustrated in the Session

1. Cognitive Defusion  
   The therapist labels the client’s mind as “slippery” and “trying to help” rather than labeling the thoughts as true or false.  This externalizes and de-literalizes the client’s self-critical cognitions, reducing their dominance (defusion).

2. Acceptance of Private Events  
   The client describes intense physical pain, emotional volatility, and self-doubt.  The therapist does not attempt to eliminate or reframe these experiences; instead the plan is to “work around” the mind, implying willingness to have the discomfort while still moving forward.

3. Present-Moment Contact  
   The therapist repeatedly brings the client back to “Where are you right now?” and keeps a running tally of session number and medication changes.  These moves anchor the dialogue in the here-and-now rather than abstract rumination.

4. Self-as-Context  
   The client notices her black-and-white thinking (“yes or no, black or white”) and observes, “I’m trying not to think about anything too much.”  This language hints at a noticing “I” that can witness thoughts rather than be defined by them—the transcendent sense of self.

5. Values Clarification  
   The client states, “I like results,” “I like learning,” and “I need to walk and hike with my kids.”  These utterances reveal valued directions (achievement, learning, parenting, physical activity) that can guide committed action once avoidance is loosened.

6. Committed Action  
   The implicit contract to complete ten sessions and then “stop and look again” models setting a goal tied to the value of growth and self-care, even while pain and self-criticism are present.

Overall, the session exemplifies ACT’s aim: loosening the struggle with pain and self-criticism (fusion, avoidance) so the client can move toward what matters—continued learning, active parenting, and physical engagement—while making room for the inevitable aches, doubts, and “basket-case” moments.
