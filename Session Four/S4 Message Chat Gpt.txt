"Remember, there’s a part of you that can observe your experiences without judgment. This 'neutral you' is always present, even when emotions feel overwhelming. Try to take a moment today to notice your thoughts and feelings as if you’re watching leaves float by on a stream. This practice can help you create space and choose how to respond, rather than getting caught up in the turbulence. You’re not alone in this journey."
